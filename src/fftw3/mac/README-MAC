This .zip archive contains DYLIB libraries and the associated header (.h)
and module-definition (.la) files of FFTW compiled for Mac.  It
also contains the corresponding bench test/benchmark programs
and wisdom utilities.

There are three libraries: single precision (float), double precision,
and extended precision (long double).  To use the third library,
your compiler must have sizeof(long double) == 12.

The single- and double-precision libraries use SSE and SSE2, respectively,
but should also work on older processors (the library checks at runtime
to see whether SSE/SSE2 is supported and disables the relevant code if not).

They were compiled by the GNU C compiler for MinGW, specifically:
Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)
